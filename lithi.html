    <hr>
    <p><b>Facebook is an online social media and social networking </b>>service owned by American technology giant Meta Platforms.<br> Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to only Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years</p>
<p>Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, <br><br>such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones.<storng>After registering, users can create a profile revealing information</storng>about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.</p>
<h2>history</h2>
<hr>
<p>uckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".[13] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours</p>
<p>A "face book" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information.[14] In 2003,  <i> Harvard had only a paper version[16] along with private online directories</i>.[13][17]<br> Zuckerberg told The Harvard Crimson, "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... <br>I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week."[17] In January 2004,<br> Zuckerberg coded a new website, known as "TheFacebook", inspired by a Crimson editorial about Facemash, stating, "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available </p>
<p>In May 2005, Accel Partners invested $12.7 million ($19 million in 2022 dollars[18]) in Facebook,<em> and Jim Breyer[34] added</em> $1 million ($1.5 million in 2022 dollars[18]) of his own money. A high-school version of the site launched in September 2005.[35] Eligibility expanded to include employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.[36]<br></p>
<h3>2006–2012: Public access, Microsoft alliance, and rapid growth</h3>
<p>In May 2006, Facebook hired its first intern, Julie Zhuo.[37] After a month, Zhuo was hired as a full-time engineer.[37] On September 26, 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.[38][39][40] By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves.[41] Organization pages began rolling out in May 2009</p>
<p>In May 2007, at the first f8 developers conference, Facebook announced<mark>the launch of the Facebook Developer Platform, providing a framework for software developers</mark>to create applications that interact with core Facebook features. By the second annual f8 developers conference on July 23, 2008, the number of applications on the platform had grown to 33,000, and the number of registered developers had exceeded 400,000</p>
<p><del>Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com.</del></p>
<p>Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College. Within a month, more than half the undergraduates had registered.[24] Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and <ins>On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a cleaner look</ins>Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the website.[25] In March 2004, Facebook expanded to Columbia, <sub>Stanford and Yale.[26] It then became available to all Ivy League colleges, Boston University, NYU, MIT, and successively most universities in the United States </sub>and Canada</p>
<P>In mid-2004, Napster co-founder and entrepreneur Sean Parker—an informal advisor to Zuckerberg—became company president.[29] <sup>In June 2004, the company moved to Palo Alto, California.[30]Sean Parker called Reid</sup>Hoffman to fund Facebook.</P>
