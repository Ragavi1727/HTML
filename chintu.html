    <p>Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while <a href="https://annauniv.edu/" target="_blank">annauniversity</a>attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".[13] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[14] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was<mark> shut down a few days later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion</mark> and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy.</p>
    <p> "face book" is a student directory<a href="https://onlineservices.annauniv.edu/pages/login.php" target="_blank"> annauniversity resu lt</a> featuring photos and basic information.[12] In 2003, there were no universal online facebooks at Harvard, with only paper sheets distributed[16] and private online directories.[9][17] Zuckerberg told the Crimson that "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. </p>
